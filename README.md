# LisovaWebApplication
A software solution for an open Web API of the company's employee registry that performs several basic GET requests to the local registry storage.
The software solution allows you to access data from a local database by making HTTP requests to the Web API.

The Web API provides six predefined queries to retrieve all records, a range of records, one query in full or short format.
The full format contains all information about the employee. In the short format - only the serial identification number and position and department code.
